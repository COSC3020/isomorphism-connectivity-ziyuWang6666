# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do \emph{not} have to
be completely connected. I have started with the formal definition of
isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.



## Answer
Assuming two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do not need to be completely connected, to know if it is true, to give a simple example, there are two graphs G1 and G2 all have two nodes.

Graph A:  a  b        Graph B: c  d

Obviously, they are isomorphic because they have a function of f to go one-to-one and onto. They are obviously not completely connected.
Therefore, it is true that isomorphic graphs do not need to be completely connected.
